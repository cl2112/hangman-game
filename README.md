# hangman-game

ideas for the game:

	health bars for you and your opponent (the word your trying to guess)

	background like an arcade cabinet

	when you start the game it plays the intro sound for the street fighter game(maybe with the coin being inserted sound)

	have an image for you and your opponent, character sprites from the game - and when you guess wrong your chara plays the hit animation and when you guess right the opponent gets hit
