# hangman-game

ideas for the game:

	health bars for you and your opponent (the word your trying to guess)

	background like an arcade cabinet

	when you start the game it plays the intro sound for the street fighter game(maybe with the coin being inserted sound)

	have an image for you and your opponent, character sprites from the game - and when you guess wrong your chara plays the hit animation and when you guess right the opponent gets hit

	You can make a function for searching arrays and have it output to true if its there and false if its not.

	function isItInArray(array,checking,) {
		if (array.indexOf(checking) == -1) {
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
	};

	questions to ask:

	how to make the font-size be responsive!!!

	working with gifs, making them stop , timing with js

	Callback functions

	playing sounds

	use text-shadow for the letters.!!!!!!!!!!!
